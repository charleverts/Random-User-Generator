# Random-User-Generator

Code for the Vue.js Random-User-Generator tutorial by Traversy Media. Much of the code had to be adjusted since tutorial was from 2021. 

The app generates random users: Names, Emails, Pictures when the button is clicked. The theme is blue or pink based on the gender of the user. Random users generated via the 'https://randomuser.me/api/' which returns user data in a json dict.

To run the app locally, install the Live Server extension.
